1. In recursion algorithm, the parameter has 2 type can be choice if has 'STRING'
   The String and StringBuilder(StringBuffer)
   No reference about the cache use and GCC solution, just talking the 'PARAM'
   Once String + "" as a param, the origin String is unchanged.
   But StringBuilder.append(i), The origin StringBuilder is changed, In recursion
   You need to delete the last element and transfer to another recursion.

2. In Greedy algorithm, the benchmark is constantly changed. So consecutive update is needed.

1. In recursion, too. the List can't be directly add.
   Because the List's location is invariable, if List changed, the Lists is changed.

1. Master the Data Structure can reduce the running time. Like utilizing the List in Map.
